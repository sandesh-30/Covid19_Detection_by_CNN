## Problem Statement

## Dataset
The dataset can be found at <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/tawsifurrahman/covid19-radiography-database"> Kaggle</a>.

## Model Architecture
The CNN architecture we implemented is inspired from this research paper by Emrah Irmak (<a href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/physiolgenomics.00084.2020"> Paper </a>).But we have implemented just the task I of it.

## Model Performance
* Training accuracy : 97.42 %
* validation accuracy : 95.16 %
* Test performance
* * Test accuracy : 96.13
* * Test AUC-ROC : 0.95
* * Test F1 score : 0.92

## Key highlights 
* Developed Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based approach for binary classification of Covid-19 patients through chest X-rays
* Trained the 12 layered CNN model on 7000+ X-rays and achieved an accuracy of 96.13% and AUC-ROC score of 0.95 on test data
